I looked at the Heap slides, it seems simple. The operations you can do are building the heap($\Theta(n)$), looking at the minimum ($\Theta(1)$), extracting the minimum ($\Theta(log(n))$),decreasing a key in the heap ($\Theta(log(n))$), and then inserting a key in the heap ($\Theta(log(n))$). The heap property is mantained thanks to the Heapify algorithm. It doesn't look so difficult to understand.
